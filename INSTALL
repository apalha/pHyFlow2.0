REQUIREMENTS

To install pHyFlow you need the following install requirements:

- python 2.7 
- cuda
- numpy
- scipy
- dolfin
- matplotlib

==============================================================================

==============================================================================
INSTRUCTIONS

Change the install directory to one of your desire. For that edit the file
install.py that is in the root dir of pHyFlow. Change the parameters in 'User
defined installation parameters' to what suits you:

Example:

	#############################################################################
	# User defined installation parameters

	libParent = '/media/DATAPART1/programs/lib/python' # root install directory
	
	#############################################################################
   
   This will install pHyFlow into '/media/DATAPART1/programs/lib/python'. In the end
   you will have a directory '/media/DATAPART1/programs/lib/python/pHyFlow' with the
   necessary files and file structure to run pHyFlow.

In the root directory of pHyFlow simple run:

	python install.py
